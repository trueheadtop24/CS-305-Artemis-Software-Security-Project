# CS-305-Artemis-Software-Security-Project

Artemis Financial is a company that helps people manage their money. 
They asked for help to make their website safer, especially when sending or receiving files. 
The big problem was that their website didn’t check if files were safe or if the data had been changed. 
They also weren’t using a secure connection. 
I helped them by adding file checks using something called a checksum, and I set up secure communication so that hackers can’t steal or change the information.

To make sure everything worked and stayed safe, I tested the website after making changes. 
I used a special tool called OWASP Dependency-Check to find problems in the code, like unsafe software pieces. 
One tricky part was figuring out which problems were real and which were just false alarms. 
But it helped a lot. 
I’d show this project to future jobs to prove that I can fix code, make it secure, and use tools that protect websites from hackers.
